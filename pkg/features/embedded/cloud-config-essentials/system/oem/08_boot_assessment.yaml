# The boot assessment works in this way:
# - After we upgrade, we set a grub env sentinel variable indicating that we did run an upgrade
# - At the first boot, if we did an upgrade, we set another sentinel variable, which indicates we are trying to boot
# - If we boot fine, we remove both sentinels
# - If we get back again at the GRUB menu, a failure must have occurred and we select the fallback entry, creating also
#   sentinels files and a specific cmdline option indicating we failed booting after an upgrade

name: "Boot assessment"
stages:
    boot.before:
    # Remove any grub sentinel and add
    # System sentinel to /run to indicate if we are booting after a failed upgrade.
    # This needs to run only on the active partition.
    # To note, we could similarly enable boot assessment always, also besides upgrades.
    # In this case it is enough to reset only boot_assessment_tentative here, and set 
    # enable_boot_assessment to 'yes'.
    # This can be then customized easily by having a cloud-config file which always enables boot assessment on 
    # the boot stage.
