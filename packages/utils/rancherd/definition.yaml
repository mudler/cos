# our default versioner removes the last -XX values from the version, to avoid using our own bumped versions whcih add a -XX
# to it, so in the case of rancherd which already includes a -alphaXX we have to append another -XX so the real version
# will be maintained and cloned, i.e 0.0.1-alpha14, otherwise it will remove the -alpha14 and fail to build
