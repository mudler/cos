In the `cOS` repository are present meta packages that are collection of packages which are suitable for different needs.

We can compare them to `bundles` which pulls in during installation sub-packages which should be installed in the system target.

For example, we have `cos-minimal` and `cos-core`: `cos-core` is the minimum required of packages in order for having a working `cOS` derivative, while `cos-minimal` have additional `cloud-init` configurations that allows a system in order to boot properly.
