Elemental-toolkit is a toolkit to build, ship and maintain cloud-init driven Linux derivatives based on container images with a common featureset - allows container images to be bootable in VMs, baremetals, embedded devices, and much more.

It is designed to reduce the maintenance surface, with a flexible approach to provide upgrades from container registries. It is cloud-init driven and also designed to be adaptive-first, allowing easily to build changes on top.

Documentation is available at [https://rancher.github.io/elemental-toolkit/docs](https://rancher.github.io/elemental-toolkit/docs)

## Design goals

- A Manifest for container-based OS. It contains just the common bits to make a container image bootable and to be upgraded from, with little customization on top
- Immutable-first, but with a flexible layout
- Cloud-init driven
- Based on systemd
- Built and upgraded from containers
- OTA updates
- Easy to customize
- Cryptographically verified
