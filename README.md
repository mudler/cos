# [![Packages](https://rancher-sandbox.github.io/cos-toolkit-package-browser/badge/cos-toolkit-green.svg "List of packages")](https://rancher-sandbox.github.io/cos-toolkit-package-browser/cos-toolkit-green) containerOS toolkit

containerOS (**cOS**) is a toolkit to build, ship and maintain cloud-init driven Linux derivatives based on container images with a common featureset - allows container images to be bootable in VMs, baremetals, embedded devices, and much more.

It is designed to reduce the maintenance surface, with a flexible approach to provide upgrades from container registries. It is cloud-init driven and also designed to be adaptive-first, allowing easily to build changes on top.

Documentation is available at [https://rancher-sandbox.github.io/cos-toolkit-docs/docs](https://rancher-sandbox.github.io/cos-toolkit-docs/docs)

## Design goals

- A Manifest for container-based OS. It contains just the common bits to make a container image bootable and to be upgraded from, with few customization on top
- Immutable-first, but with a flexible layout
- Cloud-init driven
- Based on systemd
- Built and upgraded from containers - It is a [single image OS](https://quay.io/repository/costoolkit/releases-green)!
- OTA updates
- Easy to customize
- Cryptographically verified

### Quick start
