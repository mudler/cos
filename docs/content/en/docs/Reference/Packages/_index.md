  This section contains documentation for core packages present in the elemental toolkit repositories
---

There are a set of core packages available in the Elemental repositories which are installable with `luet` while creating a derivative in the Dockerfile. Those bring in new features, enhancements and core features of the Elemental toolkit. Some are optional (like runtime features) while some of them are strictly necessary in order for a Elemental system to boot and operate correctly. 

This section contains reference documentation specific to core packages in the Elemental repositories and the functionalities they bring.

All the packages available can also be browsed [here](https://rancher.github.io/elemental-toolkit-package-browser/).
